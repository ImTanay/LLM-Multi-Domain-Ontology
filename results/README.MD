# Results Directory

This directory contains all generated outputs, including:

- Fine-tuned language models (LLMs).
- CSV files from model inference, detailing classification of relationships between research topics.

**File: `FT_domain-specific_results`**
- Presents results for all LLMs, categorised by dataset type (`IEEE-Rel-3K`, `PhySH-Rel-875`, `MeSH-Rel-4K`, and `PEM-Rel-8K`).
- Lists hyperparameter settings used during fine-tuning.
- Includes results for the `SciBERT` encoder, which were omitted from the paper due to space limitations.
